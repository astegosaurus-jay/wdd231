            <p>As I have gotten older I have realized how easy it is to forget, or lose the reason why we like something in the first place. For me I have many of the same hobbies I did as a kid and in some ways I am just as passionate now as I was then. Over the last few years two of my favorite hobbies, that being gaming and collecting Pokemon cards has really felt different, I mean heck Pokemon cards feel more like a stock market than a trading card game for kids. Being partially inspired by a channel I watch on youtube, I wanted to reflect on why I fell in love with these hobbies in the first place, thus the name Nostalgic Reflection. These are things that helped me get through a difficult childhood so I decided to take some photos and write some thoughts and memories about them. I encourage you the reader to also reflect on your hobbies or passions and maybe write down some fond memories as well.</p>
