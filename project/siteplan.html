    </header>

    <main>
        <div>
            <h1>Site Name: Nostalgic Reflection</h1>
            <p>The reason I choose this name is because I want to look back at the hobbies and passions I had growing up and reflect on how they made me who I am today and why I fell in love with them in the first place</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Site purpose</h1>
            <p>Countinuing off of the prior paragraph, I want to archive some of the things I had growing up and reflect on its impact on me. I think it is so easy now to lose that joy in so many hobbies now and I want to reflect on the joy of it. This will also be a way to journal for the first time for me and hopefully help encourage people to look back at their passions and hobbies themselves</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Scenarios</h1>
            <p>I am mainly doing it for myself and my family and freinds. Also for people who feel the same about their hobbies. One example would be how can I reflect on my passions. How can I share my memories with the ones I love.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Color</h1>
            <p>I will use purple the headers. I will use a grey for the background colors</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>Typography</h1>
            <p>I will use cabin font for the headers. I will use nata sans on paragraphs.</p>
        </div>
